# YamYams

A small project that is free to use. ðŸŽ‰

I wanted to offer a starting point for anyone interested in replacing YAML with Go.

You can read more about the thinking behind this in [this blog post](https://nivenly.com/lib/2021-06-13-ias/).

### The Interface

We hope to offer an interface that "applications" can implement that we can then write generic tooling around.

Hopefully we can offer Go as an alternative to YAML and templating so we can take advantage of the vast Go ecosystem.
